# Proflow GUI

The proflow gui library.

# Build

To build the package run `yarn install && yarn build`. This will compile the javascript code into a single file and copy it to `../../proflow/analysis/webview/static/force/index.js`

You can then run the app with `proflow/analysis/webview/run_app.py `. This should probably be tidied up a bit!
